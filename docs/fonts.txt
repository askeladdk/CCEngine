RA1 Fonts and Palettes
(written by Askeladd)

This document explains what fonts RA1 uses and how they are paletted.

Fonts are encoded in 4BPP and hence can only use up to 16 colours,
though most fonts use either the lower 8 or the upper 8 palette entries.
This means that one palette file can be used by multiple fonts.

But which palette goes with which font? This is not documented anywhere and there no specific
font palettes to be found in the .mix files. Long story short, I reverse engineered
the palettes by examining screenshots and using Nyerguds' Font Editor.

I created the following palettes which can be used by the fonts:
- FONT.PAL: The lower half has a white hue and the upper half has a green gradient. Which half is used depends on the font.
- HELP.PAL: Used together with HELP.FNT to display tooltips.
- GRAY.PAL: A generic 16 colour grayscale palette.
- VCR.PAL: This is a RA1 version of CNCs VCR.PAL and has a white hued gradient in its upper half.

These are the fonts used by RA1:
- GRAD6FNT.FNT: Used to display the in-game messages to inform the player. Use with FONT.PAL.
- 12METFNT.FNT: Used to caption menu widgets and the mission briefing text. Use with FONT.PAL to get a white hue. In some interface menus this font has a differently coloured hue.
- HELP.FNT: Tooltip font. Use with HELP.PAL for yellow-black colours.
- SCOREFNT.FNT: Used in the score screen. Works with GRAY.PAL though the precise palette is not yet known.
- VCR.FNT: A bigger gradient font, possibly used to write the "mission accomplished" text? Can be used with VCR.PAL for a white gradient or FONT.PAL for a green gradient.
- TYPE.FNT: This typewriter font is unused but might be cool as an alternative mission briefing font.
- LED.FNT: Unused but has wide spacing between characters.
- 3POINT.FNT: Too small to be readable.
- 6POINT.FNT: Non-gradient version of GRAD6FNT. Possibly used by the DOS version of RA1.
- 8POINT.FNT: Bigger than 3POINT yet despite its name smaller than 6POINT.
